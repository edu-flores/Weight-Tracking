# Weight-Tracking
First "useful" program created with Python 3.6.

In this program, you enter how many times you weighed yourself (I weigh myself more than once in order to have a more precise answer)
and then you get the average of that in the "Log.txt" file.

You can either enter a new log, restart all previous logs, print previous logs, or quit the program.
